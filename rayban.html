                            <br><strong>BRIEF</strong>
                            <br>To create a digital experience for their customers.
                            <br>
                            <br><strong>RESEARCH</strong>
                            <br>We found out that Samsung has a vast range of products and is a very technologically advanced brand, but it’s customers are not really aware about it.
                            <br>
                            <br><strong>SOLUTION</strong>
                            <br>To create an unforgettable experience for the customers and at the same time to make them discover the Samsung world. The best way to do that is through a game that will entertain them and at the same time educate the customers about the products and create a connection with them. We named our app "Samsung Contact" because through our game we are trying to bring the Samsung products in contact with the customers.

                                <br>The brief was to review ray-ban.com/usa website’s design with the goal of maximising user experience and revenues during the Holiday Season.
                                <br>
                                <br><strong>SOLUTION</strong>
                                <br>In our re-design, we wanted to focus on creating an interactive and a memorable experience for the customers with a consistent visual identity and good storytelling, so as to give a personality to the website on the whole. We started analyzing the pain points of the website and then priotizised and grouped our insights and then started finding solutions through our design and communication.

						<h3>Goals</h3>
					
						<p>While analysing the pain points of the exisiting website, we understood that the website didn't have a strong personality or a story and there were too many elements and products, which makes it difficult to find the right product a customer might be looking for.<br><br>Through our design we wanted to achieve certain goals to communicate a consistent visual identity and give a new structure to the website which in a way makes it easy for the customers to find the right product they are looking for.</p>
					
						<h4>#1 Understand the type of website</h4>
					
						<img class="content_image" src="Imgs/WorkPages/Rayban/home1.png" alt="Rayban">
					
						<h4>#2 Include the main nav categories</h4>
					
						<img class="content_image" src="Imgs/WorkPages/Rayban/menu.png" alt="Rayban">
					
						<h4>#3 Invest in bespoke imagery and design</h4>
					
						<img class="content_image" src="Imgs/WorkPages/Rayban/home3.png" alt="Rayban">
					
						<h4>#4 Prominent search field</h4>
					
						<img class="content_image" src="Imgs/WorkPages/Rayban/prominentSearch.png" alt="Rayban">
					
						<h3>Search result pages</h2>
					
						<p>In the search, we prevented trashing through autosuggest that can recommend related queries and also autocorrect if word is mispelt</p>

						<h3>Holiday Campaign</h2>
					
						<p><strong>OBJECTIVE:</strong> Our objective for the campaign according to the given brief is to increase revenue by bringing more people to the website.<br><br><strong>TARGET:</strong> Male/Female aged 15-50 in USA. With particular attention for the young crowd (15-30).<br><br><strong>IDEA:</strong> As the campaign is for the holiday season and during this season people search for special offers and are more willing to spend their money, we decided to push the customization option of Rayban, as it is something that already has a good response amongst the users and it generates more revenue than a regular product. So to push customization we came up with the idea of <strong>"TECHNICOLOR"</strong>, where in the week of the campagin, each day will be assigned with a color and when the customers customize their product with that color touch of the day, they will get a 20% off.</p>
