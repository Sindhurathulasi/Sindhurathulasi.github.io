                            <br><strong>BRIEF</strong>
                            <br>To create a digital experience for their customers.
                            <br>
                            <br><strong>RESEARCH</strong>
                            <br>We found out that Samsung has a vast range of products and is a very technologically advanced brand, but it’s customers are not really aware about it.
                            <br>
                            <br><strong>SOLUTION</strong>
                            <br>To create an unforgettable experience for the customers and at the same time to make them discover the Samsung world. The best way to do that is through a game that will entertain them and at the same time educate the customers about the products and create a connection with them. We named our app "Samsung Contact" because through our game we are trying to bring the Samsung products in contact with the customers.

                                <br>Freo Save is a digital savings bank account in partnership with Equitas Small Finance Bank. We built this product from scratch and went live in 9 months.<!-- that offers 7% interest on savings. Apart from the high-interest rate, we also had to define the value proposition that differentiates us from the other neo-banks.-->

                        <h3>Why we built Freo Save?</h3>
					
						<p>We built Freo Save to solve both, the user’s & the company's needs. From a <strong>user standpoint</strong>, we solved two aspects. Firstly, Freo Save made banking accessible, simple & user-friendly via the neo-banking model with high-interest rates on savings. Secondly, getting access to credit via banking actions and the boxes proposition provided a worthy substitute for the need of consuming bad-quality credit products to build or improve one’s credit profile and save and grow money faster.<br><br>From the <strong>company standpoint</strong>, Freo's core product (MoneyTap), is a digital money lending platform wherein due to the nature of the business, Freo won’t be able serve almost 90% of the acquired users because of the risk policies involved in approving a customer. So, Freo Save provided a perfect way of serving such user segments & making them serviceable for near-future lending at the same time.</p>
                    
						<!--<h3>Our value proposition</h3>
					
						<p>To define our value proposition, we did user surveys, market research, and competitor analysis. We sent questionnaires to different customer profiles asking what they would like to use and then profiled them as per salary, credit score, and age. The highest hits were for getting access to credit via the savings account and next was the 7% interest on savings.<br><br>As Freo’s primary product is a replenishing line of credit (MoneyTap), we wanted to use the credit aspect to our advantage. Along  with the 7% interest on savings, we came up with boxes, a proposition that promises access to different boxes for different customer needs like credit box, investment box,  goals box, mystery box, etc.</p>-->
                    
              
                        <h3>Design process</h3>
                    
						<h4>1. User surveys and market research</h4>
                        <p>The product management team and I started with reaching out to users by sending out surveys to understand their banking needs and expectations. We then started to identify the short falls in the current digital savings products and what we could do better as opposed to our competitors.<br><br>By comprehensively critiquing the existing neo-banking products & brainstorming on the findings with the PM, we were able to narrow down to the initial UX approach along with finalizing requirements for the core features, communications, and customer support.</p>
                    
                        <h4>2. Information architecture</h4>
                    
                        <p>Based on the information we collected during our research, PM and I came up with various feature sets and started prioritizing them with respect to different use cases. We also had to keep the banking partners constraints in mind and work around it while defining UX flow.<br><br>Account opening journey was mainly defined based on the mandatory questions required by our banking partner. It consists for 5 steps post login and email verification. Starting from PAN details, personal details, professional details, aadhaar details and lastly nominee details. The primary navigational elements after account creation are Home, Boxes and the center fab for easy access to quick actions and menu.<!--Home contains all the savings account related actionables like checking balance, adding money, fund transfer, recent transactions, my card, account details, payee list, pending actions, referral entry point etc. The boxes section covers the entry points for different types of boxes like credit, goals, investments etc. Quick actions plus button primarily serves to aid the accessibility of certain actions like Add money, transfer funds, card management etc. Lastly, the menu contains account details, card settings, security, language, help and support, T&C & privacy policy, and logout.--></p>

						<h4>3. Wireframes</h4>
                        <p>I started off with low-fidelity wireframing by sketching my vision of the user journey on paper. After back and forth discussions and feedbacks sessions with my PM and head of design on the structure of the interface, I moved to high-fidelity wireframing.<br><br>While working on the hi-fi wireframes, we had taken feedback from the internal teams and our banking partner Equitas Small Finance bank at various points and kept iterating with respect to their feedback.</p>

                        <h4>Making the app vernacular</h4>
					
						<p>We wanted to cater to a larger customer base, to achieve this we wanted to provide access to easy digital banking to tier 2 and tier 3 cities as well. Hence, we decided to make the app accessible in regional languages. Currently we are live in English, Hindi and Tamil. We plan to add another 6 to 7 languages in the coming releases.</p>

                        <!--<h4>Process of making Freo Save live</h4>
					
						<p>Based on our interactions with our banking partner, we decided to first have a CUG (Closed User Group) launch limited to only 3000 users.  It was agreed to only launch it within the internal employees, family and friends base. CUG happened mid-march 2022.<br><br>We created an invite-only setup to provide access to selected members. This phase helped us identify few issues upfront and prepared us better for the full scale launch. Post multiple rounds of testing, customer calls, banking partner approvals, the full scale launch successfully happened on May 18th, 2022. </p>-->
                    
                    
                        <h4>Tools used for funnel improvement</h4>
					
						<p>Post the app went live, we started monitoring the funnel on a daily basis to draw inferences to improve the product and the overall funnel. Our in-house data team created a superset dashboard which was used to analyze the primary dropoff points in the funnel.<br><br>With the help of user experior, I went through the screens, checked the heatmap analysis, and started drawing inferences and identified similar behaviours and issues. Our product team also did customer calls in order to understand customer concerns in depth.Below I'm demonstrating one example for reference on how we improved the dropoff by 20% in one of our key screens.</p>
