                                <br><strong>BRIEF</strong>
                                <br>Use case 2 : <br>For a elite international user group who are high networth individuals working in MNCs in top posts. These people doesn't have much spare time and would want to see minimal to the point things they want to buy or gift. They are looking for premium items, imported things or probably rare items set for auction, etc. The CEO of this e-commerce site kept it invite only so keep things ultra luxurious, e-commerce club.
                                <br>
                                <br><strong>SOLUTION</strong>
                                <br>As the target group are elite people and are looking for a minimalistic to the point things, I decided to keep the interface neat and also user friendly at the same time.

                        <h4>Task 1</h4>
                    
                        <p>A website asks you for a phone number and needs you to get it right. When you enter your ten-digit phone number, you see something like this. Please suggested improve UI for this phone control.</p>

                        <p><strong>Solution: </strong>The key to good user experience is preventing the user from making an error than correcting them after.<br>- Adding the flag icon aids preventing user from having to type the country code extension<br>- Auto-formatting with respect to the country code prevents the user from inputting a wrong format<br>- Masking the input makes it easier for the users to validate the number</p>
                    
                        <h4>Task 2</h4>
                    
                        <p>How can you improve this feedback form?</p>
                    
                        <img class="content_image big" src="Imgs/WorkPages/Leadsquared/FeedbackForm_task.png" alt="Feedback form">
                    
                        <img class="content_image biggest" src="Imgs/WorkPages/Leadsquared/Feedback_solution.png" alt="Feedback form">
                    
                        <p><strong>Solution: </strong>In any feedback form, asking the right questions is the key. The users don’t really have the patience to completely read and fill the form.<br>- Framed the question differently so that it can be read easily<br>- As the level of satisfaction is number based, I put them in an input selector instead of hiding the options in a dropdown<br>- Added the parameters (Not very satisfied - Very satisfied) close to the number scale range (0 - 10) so that the user’s eye need not travel back and forth for reference<br>- Highlighted the required field as it is only one field as opposed to the optional fields</p>
                    
                        <h4>Task 3</h4>
                    
                        <p>Redesign this parking sign which can drive anyone crazy. When you are trying to park a car and see the sign, you have very limited time to understand the sign. So your design should consider that aspect – which is an individual should be able to understand at a single glance whether they can park at that moment or not. The design should also consider the fact that the number of constraints can increase over a period of time – meaning the sign below has constraints on Friday through Monday. There could be additional constraints on other weekdays and hours in the future.</p>

                        <p><strong>Solution: </strong><br>- Arrow being on top makes it easier to understand the direction the parking guide<br>- As there can be additional constraints on the other weekdays, I have added all days and given them space so that those changes can be accommodated without any issue<br>- Used graphical icons to represent different signs as it makes it easier for people to scan through the sign board and understand if they can park or not<br>- Added differentiation for paid and free parking to make it more clear<br>- Added legend so that it will be easier for all kinds of users ranging from different age groups to understand better and faster<br>- Color is another factor that aids in scanning the sign board easily, used green and red for the do's and don’t respectively<br>- Font used is Helvetica as it is very easily readable and simple as that is an important factor for legibility<br>- As it also contains paid parking, it is important to have a way to be able to easily pay or atleast review the fares. That is the reason for adding the QR code option as another way to pay<br>- Tow-away is another use case scenario where it is important to help users understand who to reach out to to get any information with regard to their towed vehicle</p>
                    
                        <h4>Task 4</h4>
                    
                        <p>Design a better 500 internal server error page</p>

                        <p><strong>Solution: </strong>Whenever there is an occurrence of an error, users generally tend to get lost, so it is very important to give them help and redirect them to the right page.<br>- Added ways for the user to reach out and also linked the help center for any additional information<br>- Option to redirect to a relevant page<br>- Error messages can be annoying to the users, so adding good illustration will always aid in the look and feel of the page<br>- The way the error is communicated is also important, it is always good to inform the user that the error is being worked on</p>
