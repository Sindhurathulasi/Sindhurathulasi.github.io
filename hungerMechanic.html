                            <br><strong>BRIEF</strong>
                            <br>To create a digital experience for their customers.
                            <br>
                            <br><strong>RESEARCH</strong>
                            <br>We found out that Samsung has a vast range of products and is a very technologically advanced brand, but it’s customers are not really aware about it.
                            <br>
                            <br><strong>SOLUTION</strong>
                            <br>To create an unforgettable experience for the customers and at the same time to make them discover the Samsung world. The best way to do that is through a game that will entertain them and at the same time educate the customers about the products and create a connection with them. We named our app "Samsung Contact" because through our game we are trying to bring the Samsung products in contact with the customers.

						<h3>Problem statement</h3>
					
						<p>Cooking is a task in itself, especially for beginners. How many times have we looked online for recipes and ended up being disappointed because we might not necessarily have all the required ingredients for that particular recipe. But by the time we realise that we don’t have the ingredients, we would have already invested quite a lot of time going through that recipe. We have to now again restart our search to find one with the ingredients that we have.<br>Another problem is with measurements and quantity of the ingredients, not knowing how much to use for a certain set of serving.</p>
                    
                    
                        <h3>Solution</h3>
					
						<p>First step is to rethink the search for finding recipes. We can give them an option to choose the ingredients that they have and then show the list of recipes that they can make with the chosen ingredients. This way we would be saving a lot of their time. Also adding an option to choose the number of people that they are cooking for, we can show the exact amount of measurements and quantity, making it super easy and clear for the users.</p>
                    
                        
                        <h3>Design process</h3>
                    
						<h4>1. Field visits & user interview</h4>
                        <p>The first step is to be able to empathise the users, to do so we should understand and identify the challenges faced by them in their current process. To do so, my product manager and I went to the field to understand their current process and the pain points they face on a daily basis. We met various credit managers individually and asked them to walk us through their entire process, so that we’ll be able to get a different perspective from each one of them. </p>
                    
                        <h4>2. Understanding existing process</h4>
                        <p>After going for multiple visits and interacting with different credit managers, I started to understand how they achieve their goals using the current process. With my learning, I understood that the journey was a mix of physical and digital touch points. To get a holistic view, I broke the entire lending journey according to their current process into 12 steps starting from lead generation to disbursement of the loan.</p>

						<h4>3. Information architecture</h4>
                        <p>Based on the information we collected during our research, PM and I came up with various feature sets and started prioritising them with respect different use cases. I kept all the pain points in mind while defining the information architecture. They need one platform to monitor and manage their team and achieve the targets assigned to them in the shortest span.<br><br>The parent elements that I defined are dashboard, cases, visits, members, meetings and inbox. In the dashboard, the manager will get a complete overview of his team, their performance, customer summary etc. The cases section will give all the real-time information about all the customers pertaining to different stages of the lending cycle. Visits and members section will give an overall picture to the managers about all the visits assigned and individual team members performance. Lastly, meetings section acts like an internal meetings calendar and inbox for their communication and broadcasting channel.</p>

						<h4>4. Wireframes</h4>
                        <p>I started off with low-fidelity wireframing  by sketching my vision of the user journey on the white board. After back and forth discussions and feedback sessions with my PM on the structure of the interface, I moved to high-fidelity wireframing.</p>

                        <p>While working on the hi-fi wireframes, I took multiple feedback sessions with the credit managers and their business head at various points and kept iterating with respect to their feedback.</p>
                    
                        <img class="content_image biggestest" src="Imgs/WorkPages/Credit/high_wireframes.png" alt="Credit">
					
						<h4>5. Visual designs</h4>
					
						<p>I wanted to keep the interface clean and clear with less clutter. This is how the final UI of the manager dashboard looks like.</p>
