						<h3>My Story</h3>
                        <p>The mere thought that someone has designed each and everything surrounding us has always amazed me. Since when I was a kid, I have always been very ardent about drawing and creating new things. Every last page of my school notebooks was always filled with abstract doodles, which slowly started molding into definite shapes and later grew up to be my passion. I did my Bachelors in <strong>Visual Communication</strong> in Chennai.<br>Learning and bettering myself have always excited me so I departed from India and went to <strong>Milan</strong> to do my <strong>Dual master's in Visual and Web design</strong>. After my master’s I worked for almost a year and a half at <strong>Noone</strong>, a design studio in Milan, where I got to both UI/UX and branding. This whole experience definitely helped shape me both professionally and personally, it broadened my exposure. Post this, I moved back to India and joined <strong>Loktra Technologies</strong> as a UI/UX designer, where I got to build products to aid the process of making the lending lifecycle better and simpler.<br><br> After Loktra, I started working for <strong>Freo (Previously MoneyTap)</strong> as a Senior Product Designer. At Freo, I have worked on the core product (MoneyTap,  a personal line of credit) to improve the existing experience and I spearheaded the design efforts for the Freo Save platform, a digital savings bank account developed in collaboration with Equitas Small Finance Bank. This involved guiding the project from its conceptualization to making it live within a 9-month timeframe.My role extended beyond design ideation, as I was actively involved in the entire process, from crafting the user interface to ensuring a seamless handoff with the tech team. Taking ownership of the design-to-build process allowed me to guarantee that the envisioned user experience was accurately reflected in the final outcomes.<br><br>I see myself as a designer constantly seeking to learn, build products, identify and solve user problems which in return helps in the overall product.</p>
