                        <h2>My Story</h2>

						<p>The mere thought that someone has designed each and everything surrounded by us has always amazed me. Since when I was a kid I have always been very ardent about drawing and creating new things. Every last page of my school notebooks were always filled with abstract doodles, which slowly started moulding into definite shapes and later grew up to be my passion. Designing has always given me an immeasurable amount of happiness which is the soul reason why I chose to pursue my passion as my career. Therefore, it was a natural choice for me to do my Bachelors in Visual Communication. Soon after my bachelors, I started to intern in different fields of my interest in my country. Finally departed from India and came to Milan to do my Dual masters in Visual and Web design to reach a step closer to my ambition of making a space for myself in the field of design. I see myself as a growing designer successfully shaping brands, as a person being able to easily blend in multicultural environments and as someone who has lots of fun doing her work.</p>
