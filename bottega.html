                            <br><strong>BRIEF</strong>
                            <br>To create a digital experience for their customers.
                            <br>
                            <br><strong>RESEARCH</strong>
                            <br>We found out that Samsung has a vast range of products and is a very technologically advanced brand, but it’s customers are not really aware about it.
                            <br>
                            <br><strong>SOLUTION</strong>
                            <br>To create an unforgettable experience for the customers and at the same time to make them discover the Samsung world. The best way to do that is through a game that will entertain them and at the same time educate the customers about the products and create a connection with them. We named our app "Samsung Contact" because through our game we are trying to bring the Samsung products in contact with the customers.

                                <br><strong>RESEARCH</strong>
                                <br>In our research phase, we found out that Bottega Veneta is one of the few luxury brands that really wants to know it's customers to provide an experience that adapts to their personalities.
                                <br>
                                <br><strong>SOLUTION</strong>
                                <br>We came up with "Incontro" - An idea to build a personal relationship between the brand and it's customers that grows in depth with time. We wanted to weave human and digital together.
