							<p>Bottega Veneta is a group project for the course Digital Art Direction, under the professor Andy Scupelli. The client’s brief was to create a digital experience to facilitate omni-channel experience that is personal.<br><br>In our research phase, we found out that Bottega Veneta is one of the few luxury brands that really wants to know its customers to provide an experience that adapts to their personalities. Thus we came up with the idea to build a personal relationship between the brand and its customers that grows in depth with time. We wanted to weave human and digital together.</p>
