                            <br><strong>BRIEF</strong>
                            <br>To create a digital experience for their customers.
                            <br>
                            <br><strong>RESEARCH</strong>
                            <br>We found out that Samsung has a vast range of products and is a very technologically advanced brand, but it’s customers are not really aware about it.
                            <br>
                            <br><strong>SOLUTION</strong>
                            <br>To create an unforgettable experience for the customers and at the same time to make them discover the Samsung world. The best way to do that is through a game that will entertain them and at the same time educate the customers about the products and create a connection with them. We named our app "Samsung Contact" because through our game we are trying to bring the Samsung products in contact with the customers.

                                <br><strong>BRIEF</strong>
                                <br>The brief was to come up with a campaign for Nike for the Rio Olympics 2016.
                                <br>
                                <br><strong>RESEARCH & SOLUTION</strong>
                                <br>In our research we found out that from being titled one of the most dangerous cities, the city Rio has come a long way and now is in the middle of a growing path made of different steps and on the other hand Nike is inviting it’s consumers to believe anybody can be successful by being perseverant. We combined together these two values to convey that any goal could be reached step by step. That’s the reason we named our campaign #OneStepCloser. Our campaign targets common people, thus we decided that our touch points will be places in city.

						<h3>#OneStepCloser App</h3>
					
						<p>The app is the core of the campaign. The user has to choose a goal that has to be reached by the end of the Olympics. The goals are not linked with just sports but also with lifestyle trackable activities that can improve the quality of the life of the users. Once the target is set, the app will start pushing and motivating people to reach their goal. It will send motivational quotes and also show other people that are part of the OneStepCloser community. The user can see his progresses on the main screens, have a countdown to the end of the Olympic games and see the network of OSC people.</p>

						<h3>Winner Spot</h3>

In the end it invites to download the app.</p>

						<h3>Walks of Fame</h3>
					
						<p>We decided to use every small element around the city that relates to our campaign. Some zebra crossing’s will have #OSC manifesto painted on it and some stairs will be painted with inspirational quotes by famous athletes.<br>With this we are trying to imply that "Each step you make counts" and in a way we want to motivate them in every step in reaching their goal.</p>
